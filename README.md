## Introduction

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. This project aims to apply machine learning techniques to predict whether a passenger survived or not, based on available features. The Titanic dataset is a popular choice for beginners to learn about data preprocessing, feature engineering, and building predictive models.

## Dependencies

To run this project, you will need:

- Python (version X.X.X)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended)

You can install the required Python packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-machine-learning.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd titanic-machine-learning
```

3. Install the dependencies as mentioned in the **Dependencies** section.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

2. Open the `titanic_ml_model.ipynb` notebook.

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to explore the dataset, preprocess the data, build and train the machine learning model, and make predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Titanic dataset, which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). The dataset contains information about passengers such as age, sex, class, fare, and whether they survived or not.

## Model

The machine learning model used in this project is a [random forest classifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html), which is known for its versatility and accuracy in various classification tasks.

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to assess the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome! If you find any issues or want to enhance the model, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
